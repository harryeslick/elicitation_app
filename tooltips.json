  "Status": "Completion status indicator showing whether expert has provided custom distribution parameters (✓) or is using default values (○)",
  "STATUS": "Geographic location or site where the scenario takes place",
  "CANOLA_PCT": "Type of crop or vegetation being studied in this scenario",
  "SPORACLE": "Total area of the field or study site in hectares",
  "BASELINE DISTRIBUTION": "Expected yield per hectare under normal conditions (tonnes per hectare)",
  "Baseline Distribution": "Distribution parameters for expected outcomes WITHOUT any treatment intervention. Represents the range of possible damage/loss percentages under baseline conditions.",
  "Treatment Distribution": "Distribution parameters for expected outcomes AFTER applying treatment intervention. Values should be equal to or better than baseline (≤ baseline for damage scenarios).",
